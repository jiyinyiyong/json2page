Json2page is a script aiming to make writing web pages easy in CoffeeScript.
So the template is the js objects one write in a decided format,
after that, the objects can be compiled to HTML for any use.
You may look through these demos first to get the basic concept:

And here's one page I use this to render a page:

Is a pity we can't handle DOM like what we do on other data.
JQuery is quite a good tool, but HTML itself is clumsy.
One day in April I saw this piece of code which converts json to css
https://github.com/tyrondis/jcss
It's really simple, then I got the idea to simplize html in js.
My first version of converter more or less is based on this attention.
I remmembered a script(forget..) which converts arrays to html, that's powerfull..
For js object, there's no range, no repeat.. it quite bad for html.
Only one thing: objects looks really concise in coffee, but array not.

Basicly, an object defined like this:
    input =
      $html: 'context'
